# Palindrome-Baby
In this webapp you can check wether your birthday is a palindrome or not . Now you must be thinking how it will work so let me explain it.
  First of all it will take your Date of Birth as input in the format mm/dd/yyyy and then it will change them into five more formats which are dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy/mm/dd, mm/dd/yy, dd/mm/yy and yy/mm/dd.
And then it will check Palindrom for each and every date format if any of the date format forms a palindrome then your birthday will be a palindrome else not.
Hope you will enjoy it :)
